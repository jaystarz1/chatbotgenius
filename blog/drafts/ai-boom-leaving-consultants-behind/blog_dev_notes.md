# Developmental Notes

## Overall Impression
The blog post has a strong, provocative voice and compelling narrative structure. The hook is excellent, using a real-world anecdote to draw readers in. The content successfully exposes the consulting industry's AI incompetence gap while positioning boutique firms as the solution. However, it needs more technical depth and specific implementation details to fully establish credibility with technical decision-makers.

## Structure
- **Introduction**: Excellent hook with the LinkedIn livestream anecdote - immediately engaging and sets the confrontational tone
- **Body**: Builds logically from problem identification (Big Four failures) to root causes (McKinsey paradox) to solution (boutique revolution)
- **Conclusion**: Strong resolution with clear takeaways and actionable recommendations

## Gaps / Additions
- **Technical Implementation Details**: Needs specific examples of AI architectures, tech stacks, or implementation patterns that distinguish successful from failed projects
- **Cost Breakdown**: While percentages are mentioned (40-60% savings), actual dollar comparisons would strengthen the economic argument
- **Timeline Comparisons**: More specific project timeline examples comparing Big Four vs boutique delivery speeds
- **Success Metrics**: Specific KPIs and measurement frameworks for AI ROI beyond general mentions
- **Technical Challenges**: Discussion of common technical pitfalls (data quality, model drift, infrastructure requirements)
- **Industry-Specific Examples**: More variety in industry examples beyond pharma and retail

## Redundancies / Cuts
- The "consultant hypocrisy" theme is slightly repetitive across sections 2-3
- Multiple mentions of PowerPoint/strategy decks could be consolidated
- Some overlap between "Why Scale Became a Liability" and "The Goldman Sachs Reality Check" sections

## Flow & Transitions
- Transition from "McKinsey Paradox" to "David vs. Goliath" could be smoother
- The jump from "Goldman Sachs Reality Check" to "What Actually Works" needs a bridging paragraph
- Consider reorganizing to group all evidence/statistics together before presenting solutions

## Recommendations
1. **Add Technical Credibility**: Include a brief technical comparison box showing typical Big Four "solutions" (generic cloud migrations, off-the-shelf models) vs boutique approaches (custom model architectures, edge deployment, specific optimization techniques)

2. **Strengthen Data Points**: Add more specific technical failure examples - mention common issues like:
   - Attempting to use GPT-4 for tasks requiring specialized models
   - Ignoring data governance requirements
   - Underestimating computational infrastructure needs
   - Missing MLOps and model monitoring requirements

3. **Include Implementation Framework**: Add a simple technical decision tree or framework showing when to use internal teams vs boutiques vs (rarely) Big Four

4. **Add Internal Linking**: Connect to related posts like "Why 95% of Enterprise AI Fails: The Bottom-Up Revolution" which complements this narrative

5. **Enhance CTAs**: Consider adding a mid-article CTA offering a downloadable "AI Vendor Selection Checklist" to capture leads
