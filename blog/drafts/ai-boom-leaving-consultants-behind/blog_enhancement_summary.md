- Added specific technical terminology (RAG, transformer architectures, MLOps)
- Included realistic cost estimates for GPU infrastructure
- Referenced actual AI tools and models (GPT-4, Claude, BERT, Whisper)

## Key Statistics Validated
- ✅ 70-85% AI failure rate (RAND/Gartner)
- ✅ 42% abandonment rate in 2025 (BCG)
- ✅ McKinsey's 12,000 agents / 5,000 job cuts
