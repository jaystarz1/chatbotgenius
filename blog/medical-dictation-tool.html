    <!-- Article Content -->
    <article class="article-content">
        <div class="article-container">
            <p>During a conversation with my brother, an MD and Nuclear Medicine specialist, last summer, he explained that dictating PET-CT scan findings was the most frustrating part of his job. His frustration with his dictation tool was palpable.</p>

            <p>Its inability to accurately capture his voice dictations, especially distinguishing between homonyms like "no" and "know." Beyond that was the cumbersome process of manually correcting those errors that made the most critical part of his work a massive stressor. I thought there was likely an AI solution at the time, but it was out of my grasp.</p>

            <h2>Enter OpenAI's Custom GPTs</h2>

            <p>When he mentioned it again in January, I was ready to help. OpenAI's Custom GPTs, released in November 2023, have taken all my time since then. As my proficiency increased, I wondered if he'd found a solution. During a text exchange, he wondered if he could build an AI tool to fix his dictation issues. I cheekily replied I don't know if you can, but I know I can.</p>

            <p>He said that if I could save him two minutes per scan, he'd be happy. And with that, our project began.</p>

            <h2>Project Definition</h2>

            <p>Defining the project scope included learning what the output looked like and working backward from there. I began by getting two anonymized reports as samples. I turned to ChatGPT to explain the reports and what they meant. I also used it to learn what the report headings and content mean, along with the associated medical jargon.</p>

            <p>That allowed me to use AI to build randomized input data to mimic real-world conditions. My process was methodical and iterative, where I tested one output function at a time to fine-tune the instructions. My brother didn't have time to dedicate to this, and because my AI-supported development process is rapid, I didn't have time to wait for minor feedback.</p>

            <p>After setting up the initial baseline, my brother walked me through his process over Zoom. I watched as he dictated capitalization, punctuation, and corrected words. It was a tense, annoying, and choppy process. His verbal input sounded something like this -</p>

            <div class="code-example">
                "Capital C, Comparison, colon, space, capital P, capital E, capital T, forward slash, capital C, capital T, space, August 2023, period, next line, next line..."
            </div>

            <p>To get a sentence that read:</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                Comparison: PET/CT August 2023.
            </div>

            <p>It was frustrating to watch the inefficiency. Incidentally, this has been a complaint I've always had with software and hardware. Humans should not adjust their natural behavioral patterns to fit the tools they use‚Äîautomated tools should conform to human behavior - full stop.</p>

            <p>I began building the proto-tool with an unlimited source of synthetic inputs and a visualization of the existing process. My objectives? I had two:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Build an AI tool that was so robust it could produce a cogent report from the input of a gibbon randomly tapping rocks together in bad Morse code.</li>
                <li>Deliver on my promise that I could build it for my brother.</li>
            </ol>

            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;">
                <img src="../images/doctor-1.jpeg" alt="Medical professional using the dictation tool" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
            </div>

            <h2>Client Feedback</h2>

            <p>No matter how good my simulations were, they would never replace user feedback. As we tested, I learned more about his needs and was able to capture more examples to meet them. My Custom GPT was tailored to his needs in the way he wanted. This was his tool and I never lost sight of that.</p>

            <p>Working together wasn't without its challenges, but it helped me learn more about what he wanted the tool to do. Just as my process was iterative, working with him iteratively revealed the full scope of the project. As the tool improved, he expected more of it, which is normal.</p>

            <h2>User Expectations vs Developer Expectations</h2>

            <p>He asked several times, "But why doesn't it do X?" I usually responded, "Because you didn't tell me you wanted X."</p>

            <p>I had high expectations of his ChatGPT skills because he's exceptional at many things. I made the mistake of relying on my assumption that he knew what he wanted and could express it in the way I needed to hear it. That wasn't the case and it was only through close collaboration that we teased out the details.</p>

            <p>This is probably a standard issue for developers, but it taught me that the disconnect between my expectations and reality needed adjustment. The user wants the tool they want. They don't want the tool the developer wants them to want.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> It is the developer's responsibility to tease these things out of the user. Understanding the project from the user's point of view requires enough emotional intelligence to guide the user toward their own answer. I won't comment on the stereotypical levels of emotional intelligence we think data scientists or engineers have. I will say that emotional intelligence in an AI environment focused on building personalized tools will be a critical job skill going forward.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Test & Adjust</h2>

            <p>I like to work through snags individually. I picked what I considered to be my brother's most important observation and worked on it until it was fixed, leaving the others for later. That meant some of them kept showing up as he tested the tool, which caused my brother to continue reporting on them.</p>

            <p>My failure was in properly communicating my approach early on, but when I did, things smoothed out. I don't like fixing more than one thing at a time because it makes isolating the change's impact very hard. Repeatedly hearing about the changes I didn't make was also hard, but I only had myself to blame for that.</p>

            <h2>Frictionless Processes</h2>

            <p>This tool was about transforming the work experience. My brother's initial dread of reading scans was so intense that it led him to consider early retirement. With that in mind, the importance of our project couldn't be understated. I aimed to make the process smoother and less time-consuming because he had asked me to save him two minutes per scan read.</p>

            <div class="success-box">
                <p><strong>The Real Success:</strong> The real success wasn't in time-saving but in the qualitative improvement of his work life. Once the tool was behaving consistently, I asked him if he'd save the two minutes he was looking for. I was surprised when he replied that the time was so much different using the tool that he wasn't watching the clock.</p>
                
                <p>Five minutes is five minutes. But how those five minutes go can dramatically change the experience. Eliminating the pain point and transforming the task was far better than shrinking the pain by two minutes per scan.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="ethical-section">
                <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>

                <h3>HIPAA Compliance</h3>
                <p>For those wondering, we ensured the tool met HIPAA's stringent compliance requirements. HIPAA is the 1996 US Act that sets doctor-patient confidentiality standards, the principles of which have been widely adopted in Canada. We implemented several safeguards, including excluding personal identifying information and utilizing an OpenAI Workspace. The benefit of a workspace is that OpenAI doesn't capture user inputs or outputs for training its language model. In practical terms, companies can upload intellectual property without fear of it being spilled to other users by ChatGPT4.</p>

                <h3>Human-in-the-Loop Decision Making</h3>
                <p>The tool only transcribes medical information it hears. It does not reach conclusions or recommend courses of treatment. It's important to say that, because AI can do both of those things with confidence. However, AI's level of confidence isn't matched by its ability to accurately deliver output. The tool requires the user to physically move the ChatGPT output from the tool to the electronic patient file. In doing that, the user validates the report by personally uploading it. The tool is not attached to the patient's medical record, and AI tools shouldn't be for the foreseeable future.</p>

                <p>AI's potential is seemingly unlimited, but users and developers need to innovate responsibly by respecting the ethical standards set by their industries. If ethics are breached, no one will look to the tool that breached them for answers.</p>
