   ```

2. **Edit each file to update:**
   - Price points and package names
   - Feature lists (check WEBBUILDOUTPLAN.md for exact features)
   - Hero section colors (each package should have distinct gradient)
   - Best for sections
   - Remove tier cards, replace with single package focus
   - Add comparison table showing what's included vs other packages

3. **Consistent elements to keep:**
   - Navigation structure (with ../../ paths)
   - Footer
   - Animation toggle
   - Contact section
   - Professional styling

## üéØ Success Criteria:
- [ ] All 4 remaining pages created and functional
- [ ] Each package page clearly shows pricing and features
- [ ] Maintenance option explains value proposition
- [ ] All internal links work between pages
- [ ] Mobile responsive design maintained
- [ ] Consistent branding with main site

## üìä After Completion:
1. Update WEBBUILDOUTPLAN.md to show 100% complete
2. Git add, commit, and push all changes
3. Test all pages at https://thechatbotgenius.com/web-development/
4. Ready to update main navigation to point to new structure!

## üí° Pro Tips:
- Each package page should make it clear why someone would choose that tier
- Include "upgrade anytime" messaging for lower tiers
- Add testimonials or success stories if available
- Emphasize speed (days not weeks) and ownership (no monthly fees)
- Keep SEO distinction clear: Basic/Recurring = NO SEO (private), Landing/Standard/Complete = FULL SEO

## üöÄ Start with Task 1 and work through sequentially!

The build should take about 30-45 minutes total. All the hard design work is done - just need to adapt the existing templates with new content.

**IMPORTANT:** The site is live at https://thechatbotgenius.com/web-development/ but hidden from main navigation. Keep it that way until all pages are complete!
