## Anti-Plagiarism Requirements

### Absolute Rules:
1. **No copying sequences of 5+ words** from any source
2. **Transform all sentence structures** when paraphrasing
3. **Cite every statistic** with clear attribution
4. **Use quotation marks** for all direct quotes
5. **Never copy narrative structures** or story arcs
6. **Create original titles** - search to verify uniqueness
7. **Don't mimic unique phrases** or clever wordplay without attribution

### Attribution Formats:

**For Statistics:**
- "According to [Source], 75% of..."
- "[Company] reports that..."
- "Research from [Institution] shows..."
- "Data from [Source] reveals..."

**For Quotes:**
- "[Name], [Title] at [Company], stated: '[quote]'"
- "As [Name] explained, '[quote]'"
- "'[Quote],' according to [Name]"

**For Ideas/Analysis:**
- "As [Expert] argues..."
- "[Publication]'s analysis shows..."
- "According to research by [Source]..."
- "[Company]'s findings indicate..."

### Transformation Techniques:

1. **Change Voice:** Active ↔ Passive
   - Source: "McKinsey deployed 12,000 AI agents"
   - Transform: "12,000 AI agents were deployed by McKinsey"

2. **Restructure Completely:**
   - Source: "The firm cut 5,000 jobs while implementing AI"
   - Transform: "Alongside AI implementation, workforce reductions affected 5,000 positions"

3. **Combine Multiple Sources:**
   - Don't rely on single sources for key points
   - Synthesize information from 2-3 sources per claim

4. **Create Original Examples:**
   - Don't use the same examples as sources
   - Develop unique analogies and comparisons

## Examples of Proper Transformation

❌ **WRONG:** "I watched a Fortune 500 executive tear into McKinsey on LinkedIn"
✅ **RIGHT:** "A Fortune 500 executive recently criticized McKinsey during a LinkedIn livestream"

❌ **WRONG:** "I spoke with a boutique firm founder who told me..."
✅ **RIGHT:** "A boutique firm founder reported..." or "According to industry sources..."

❌ **WRONG:** "I tracked LinkedIn data showing 3,000 consultants left"
✅ **RIGHT:** "LinkedIn data reveals 3,000 consultants departed" or "Analysis of LinkedIn profiles indicates..."

❌ **WRONG:** Copying: "The consulting industry faces an existential crisis"
✅ **RIGHT:** Transform: "Traditional consulting confronts fundamental challenges to its business model"

## Remember:
- When in doubt, don't use "I"
- Always attribute external information
- Transform, don't copy
- Jay's voice comes through opinions and analysis, not false claims
- Better to be transparent than to fabricate
