# Anti-Plagiarism Checklist for Blog Creation

## Pre-Writing Check (Research Phase)

### Source Documentation:
- [ ] Every fact has a source URL or publication name
- [ ] Direct quotes are marked with exact wording
- [ ] Unique phrases are flagged to avoid copying
- [ ] Story structures from sources are documented
- [ ] Statistics include original context
- [ ] Clever titles/headlines are noted to avoid

### Research Tracking Format:
```
FACT: [What the fact is]
SOURCE: [URL or publication]
ORIGINAL TEXT: [Exact wording from source]
HOW TO USE: [Paraphrase plan]
```

## During Writing Check

### Paraphrasing Rules:
- [ ] Changed sentence structure completely
- [ ] Used different word order
- [ ] Swapped active/passive voice where applicable
- [ ] Combined information from multiple sources
- [ ] Created original transitions between ideas
- [ ] Developed unique examples/analogies

### The 5-Word Rule:
**NEVER copy any sequence of 5 or more words**

❌ **Original:** "The consulting industry faces an unprecedented crisis of relevance"
❌ **Too Close:** "The consulting sector faces an unprecedented crisis of relevance"
✅ **Properly Transformed:** "Traditional consulting firms confront fundamental challenges to their business model"

### Attribution Checklist:
- [ ] Every statistic has "According to..." or similar
- [ ] All direct quotes use quotation marks
- [ ] Expert opinions are credited
- [ ] Research findings cite the institution
- [ ] Industry data names the source

## Transformation Techniques

### 1. Structural Transformation:
**Original:** "McKinsey cut 5,000 jobs after deploying 12,000 AI agents"
**Options:**
- "Following the deployment of 12,000 AI agents, McKinsey reduced its workforce by 5,000"
- "The introduction of 12,000 AI agents at McKinsey coincided with 5,000 position eliminations"
- "12,000 AI agents now operate at McKinsey, while the firm eliminated 5,000 roles"

### 2. Voice Change:
**Active → Passive:**
- "Researchers discovered..." → "It was discovered by researchers..."
- "The firm implemented..." → "Implementation was carried out by..."

**Passive → Active:**
- "The report was published by..." → "[Organization] published the report..."
- "It was found that..." → "Research revealed..."

### 3. Vocabulary Substitution:
- "unprecedented" → "unparalleled", "exceptional", "extraordinary"
- "crisis" → "challenge", "difficulty", "problem"
- "implement" → "deploy", "introduce", "roll out"
- "significant" → "substantial", "considerable", "notable"

### 4. Information Reordering:
**Original:** "First A happened, then B, resulting in C"
**Reordered:** "C was the outcome after B followed A"

## Post-Writing Verification

### Title Check:
- [ ] Search exact title in quotes on Google
- [ ] Check for similar titles in the industry
- [ ] Verify no matching blog posts exist
- [ ] Ensure title reflects original angle

### Phrase Matching:
- [ ] No 5+ word sequences match sources
- [ ] Key phrases are original or attributed
- [ ] Transitions are unique
- [ ] Opening/closing differ from sources

### Structure Review:
- [ ] Different narrative arc than sources
- [ ] Original organization of sections
- [ ] Unique examples and case studies
- [ ] Different conclusion approach

## Common Plagiarism Traps to Avoid

### 1. The "Thesaurus Trap":
Simply replacing words with synonyms is still plagiarism
- ❌ "Large corporations" → "Big companies"
- ❌ "Significant impact" → "Major effect"
- ✅ Complete restructuring required

### 2. The "Rearrangement Trap":
Moving sentences around without changing them
- ❌ Paragraph 1, 2, 3 → Paragraph 2, 3, 1
- ✅ Full rewriting with different structure

### 3. The "Patchwork Trap":
Combining copied sentences from multiple sources
- ❌ Sentence from Source A + Sentence from Source B
- ✅ Synthesize information into original sentences

### 4. The "Forgotten Quote Trap":
Using someone's exact words without quotation marks
- ❌ The executive said the industry is fundamentally broken
- ✅ The executive said "the industry is fundamentally broken"
